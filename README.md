# Colourmaps for scientific visualization
This repo has a large number of colourmaps to use in scientific visualizations. These colourmaps come from a range of sources:

 * [Scientific colour maps](https://zenodo.org/record/4153113#.X9ueU9ZyZhE)
 * [SciVisColour](https://sciviscolor.org/)
 * [CartoColor](https://carto.com/carto-colors/)

The colourmaps are stored in tab-delimited text format, so they should be easy to read into other languages.
